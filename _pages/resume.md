# Work Experience
* *2021 May - Present*  
        &nbsp; <small> **Full-Stack Software Engineer** </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> Central Bank of Turkish Republic </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> - Developed microservice applications to break dependencies between applications. Used Spring Boot for microservice development and Kubernetes as a server environment. </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> -  Migrated projects from commercialized dependecies into open-source technologies such as Kubernetes, PotgreSQL, and Apache Tomcat. </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> - Developed a monitoring application for data flow using Java Spring Boot and React JS. Used Kafka framework in order to monitor message flow. </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> - Added new functionalities and improved existing bugs in a React web application. </small> <br>
        
* *2019 September - 2021 May*  
        &nbsp; <small> **Data Scientist** </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> Turkish Aerospace </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> - Analyzed the time-series data of a plane component and developed predictive maintenance algorithms to get an insight into the decay of the plane parts. Applied Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and LSTM algorithms using Python, PyTorch, and Keras. </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> - Developed a data processing pipeline to improve work processes in a factory. Applied image processing algorithms such as YOLOv5 to detect people and objects; furthermore used video processing algorithms to identify people's actions. Utilized Python, Pytorch, and MySQL. </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> - Developed a dashboard-based surveillance system using cameras and reading camera data using FFmpeg. Used React on the front end to display camera recordings. </small> <br>
        
* *2018 September - 2019 July*  
        &nbsp; <small> **Junior Researcher** </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> EPFL </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> - Worked on detection of small targets in low-resolution remote sensing images. Utilized U-NET architecture in order to detect targets. </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> - Worked on a visualization library developed in MATLAB and Python. The library can draw geometrical shapes in order to illustrate remote sensing phenomena such as error ellipses. </small> <br>

* *2017 November - 2018 August*  
        &nbsp; <small> **Full-Stack Software Engineer** </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> EPFL </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> - Developed a Chrome extension to capture and record screens. Integrated the Chrome extension with React. Created the functionality of start recording / stop recording / display recordings inside the website. </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> - Developed web applications using React and Java. Used technologies of Redux, Axios, Rest API. </small> <br>
        &nbsp; <small> - Participated in defense industry software that decodes encoded aerial link-based data into meaningful commands. </small> <br>
